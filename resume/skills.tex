    	\cvskill{$\;\;\;\;\;\;$falassGUI}{A graphical application for the determination of neutron and X-ray reflectometry profiles from molecular dynamics simulation. This is available open source on \href{http://www.github.com/arm/falassGUI}{GitHub}, with executables for all major platforms to follow soon. This application was developed as part of my PhD studies.}
        \cvskill{refnx}{A python package dedicated to the application of the Abel\`{e}s matrix formalism to the analysis of reflectometry measurements. This also enables detailed statistical analysis of the resulting models by using Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo to enable Bayesian inference. I have recently been actively contributing to this open source package.}
