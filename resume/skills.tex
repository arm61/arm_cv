\cvsubsection{Software development}
    \begin{cvskillsy}
        \cvskill{\vspace{0.06cm}uravu}{a Bayesian data analysis package writing in Python and open-source. This package gives access to the powerful Bayesian inference Python packages through a simple interface to enable the application of these methods to model-dependent data analysis. uravu has been published in the Journal of Open Source Software.}
        \cvskill{kinisi}{a Python library that offers uncertainty determination and propagation from diffusion in molecular dynamics simulations. This enables the use of Bayesian inference to study diffusion in battery materials.}
		\cvskill{pylj}{pylj is an open-source Python library to facilitate student interaction with classical atomistic simulation. It is designed to operate within the Jupyter notebook framework, making it easy to implement in the classroom or computer lab. pylj has been published in the Journal of Open-Source Education.}
