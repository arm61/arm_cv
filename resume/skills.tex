    	\cvskill{falass}{A pure python library for the calculation of neutron and X-ray reflectometry data from molecular simulation. This is an open source package available on \href{http://www.github.com/arm/falassGUI}{GitHub}. This library was developed as part of my PhD studies.}\vspace{-.3cm}\\
    	
		\cvskill{pylj}{An open source Python package to aid in the teaching of molecular dynamics simulations to both undergradute and postgraduate students, within the interface of a Jupyter notebook.}\vspace{-.3cm}\\
        
        \cvskill{refnx}{A python package dedicated to the application of the Abel\`{e}s matrix formalism to the analysis of reflectometry measurements. This also enables detailed statistical analysis of the resulting models by using Markov chain Monte Carlo to enable Bayesian inference. I have recently been a heavy user of and occasional contributor to this open source package.}
