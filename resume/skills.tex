\cvsubsection{Software development}
    \begin{cvskillsy}
        \cvskill{\vspace{0.06cm}uravu}{An open-source Bayesian data analysis Python package. This gives access to powerful Bayesian inference libraries through a simple interface for model-dependent data analysis. Published in the Journal of Open Source Software.}
        \cvskill{islatu}{A open-source, documented package enabling reproducible and automated X-ray reflectometry reduction for data collected at the I07 beamline.}
        \cvskill{kinisi}{A Python library that offers uncertainty determination and propagation from diffusion in molecular dynamics simulations. This enables the use of Bayesian inference to study diffusion in battery materials.}
		\cvskill{pylj}{An open-source Python library to facilitate student interaction with classical atomistic simulation. It is designed to operate within the Jupyter notebook framework, making it easy to implement in the classroom or computer lab. Published in the Journal of Open-Source Education.}
